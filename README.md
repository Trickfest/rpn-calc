# RPN-CALC

## Introduction

As a learning exercise, implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator using test-driven
development (TDD) and set up a Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that deploys to Azure.

## General Application Requirements

* The calculator can be used by a human via a web browser.
* The calculator can be used by a client application via a RESTful API (over HTTP/HTTPS).
* When used interactively through the UI, the application displays the contents of the stack as the user makes each entry.
* When used by a client application, the application accepts a list of inputs and returns a single result.

## Other Project Considerations

### Explore as much of Azure DevOps as possible

Even though this is a one-person project, use this project to use and explore as much of Azure DevOps as possible.
For example, use Azure Boards to plan and track work as the project progresses.

### Learn something new

Besides exploring Azure DevOps, also use this project to learn something new.
For example, take the opportunity to explre a new web framework or TDD tool.
It's OK if the technology selection doesn't make total sense or is overkill for the task at hand.

### Flexible development environment

Again, mostly for the fun of it, the project should be as flexible as possible with reqards to development environment.
For example, Vim and the command line running on Ubuntu should be a supported developer setup.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, a full-blow IDE such as Visual Studio on Windows
should be an option as well.
