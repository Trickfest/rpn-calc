# Introduction 
As a learning exercise, implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator using test-driven 
development (TDD) and set up a Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that deploys to Azure.

# General Application Requirements
* The calculator can be used by a human via a web browser.
* The calculator can be used by a client application via a RESTful API (over HTTP/HTTPS).
* When used interactively through the UI, the application displays the contents of the stack as the user makes each entry.
* When used by a client application, the application accepts a list of inputs and returns a single result.

# Other Project Considerations

### Explore as much of Azure DevOps as possible
Even though this is a one-person project, use this project to use and explore as much of Azure DevOps as possible.
For example, use Azure Boards to plan and track work as the project progresses.

### Learn something new
Besides exploring Azure DevOps, also use this project to learn something new.
For example, take the opportunity to explre a new web framework or TDD tool.
It's OK if the technology selection doesn't make total sense or is overkill for the task at hand.
